The purpose of this study is to develop an effective machine learning model for detecting spam messages in SMS data, addressing the ongoing issue of unwanted and potentially harmful mobile communications. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization, the project preprocesses SMS text data and applies a variety of supervised learning algorithms to classify messages. Key models explored include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and boosting methods like AdaBoost and XGBoost. The evaluation metrics, focusing on accuracy and precision, reveal that the Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest models deliver the best performance, achieving high precision rates in distinguishing spam from legitimate messages. These findings suggest that these models are well-suited for SMS spam detection, offering a reliable solution for reducing spam and enhancing user experience in mobile communication. This work underscores the potential of machine learning in real-time spam filtering applications, with implications for broader adoption in mobile and messaging platforms.
